        The name Fortuner is derived from the English word fortune.
        The new Toyota Fortuner has <mark>replaced the old car</mark> after seven years of its existence that included a facelift. The new Fortuner has been built on a new platform as against the older TNGA platform.

        The very first noticeable alteration in the modified Fortuner is the <mark>custom Magic Black paint scheme</mark>, which makes this SUV stand out from other SUVs.
        
       <mark> Among Toyota cars</mark> for sale in the <mark>Philippines</mark> , Toyota has really made more effort in raising the bar in terms of providing high-quality fit and finish of the Fortunersâ€™ interior.</p>

The Toyota Land Cruiser is easily one of the most iconic off-road SUVs in automotive history. However, for its 70th birthday, Toyota saw fit to give this legend some welcome gifts.

Originally the name Land Cruiser first appeared in <mark>1954</mark> when a captured <mark>American</mark> Jeep by the Japanese in the second world war was reverse-engineered and a new name had to be forged for their version.

</a>
    <p>The <mark>Mahindra Thar</mark> is a compact, four-wheel drive, off-road SUV manufactured by Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd.
        Mahindra could always argue that the new Thar comes with a grid for a grille since its piece has <mark>horizontal slots</mark> as well behind its very Jeep-like seven vertical ones.

Mahindra Thar's waiting period is also plunging in <mark>months</mark> and with the launch of <mark>Mahindra XUV700</mark>, the waiting gets even longer.

However, a <mark>solid axle</mark> is used at the rear. With the coil springs, the ride on the 2020 Mahindra Thar is very car-like. There are <mark>no vertical movements</mark> to complain of either.

If you remember that Tata Motors displays the <mark>H5X concept</mark>, so Tata Harrier is based on that same concept. Based on the D8 Land Rover design, 1 million pieces are sold globally.

        Out on the wide open roads the Brezza is happy to cruise at speeds of <mark>100kmph</mark>, but you would need to down shift for overtakes.
        
        The Brezza has an ARAI economy figure of up to <mark>20.15kmpl</mark> while the 6-speed auto version is not too far behind at <mark>19.8kmpl</mark>.
